# HTTP-Server
Made an HTTP Server which runs on localhost. <br>
Has an echo method just to test out server connections other than HTTP 200 Messages.<br>
Allows for concurrent connections via multi-threading.<br>
Not that complex so just serves GET and POST requests. Enabled file download from the remote server as well as uploading a file of your own onto the remote server. <br>
Might work on HTTP compression next to improve transfer rate and optimize bandwidth use.<br>
